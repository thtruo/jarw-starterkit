# JARW Starter-Kit

Just another React Webpack (JARW) starter-kit. After spending quite a bit of time setting up my side projects from scratch, I decided to create my own starter-kit to bootstrap new personal projects. :)

This kit also assumes basic experience with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which you should really take a look at before proceeding! If you are using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), this should look familiar. 

I added a few other parts as well, which you can decide to omit or extend. These include [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), [basscss](http://www.basscss.com), [ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb), and an ESLint configuration file for you [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) users.


## Using This Kit

Feel free to fork your own from github and then run these commands

    npm install

Bam. Done. (For Now)
